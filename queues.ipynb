    "* Suppose there is a web-server hosting a web-site to declare result(s). This server can handle a maximum of 50 concurrent requests to view result(s). So, to serve thousands of user requests, a Queue would be the most appropriate data structure to use.\n",

    "* Some Operating Systems (OS) are required to handle multiple tasks called - jobs, seeking to use the processor. But we know that a processor can handle only one task at a time. Therefore, in a multitaskingoperating system, jobs are lined up (queued) and then given access to the processor according to some order. The simplest way is to give access to the processor on a FIFO basis, that is according to the order in which the jobs arrive with a request for the processor.\n",

    "* When we send print commands from multiple files from the same computer or from different computers using a shared printer. The OS puts these print requests in a queue and sends them to the printer one by one on a FIFO basis.\n"

    "\n",
    "* **DEQUEUE**: is used to remove one element at a time from the front of the queue. We can delete elements from a queue until it is empty, trying to delete an element from an empty queue will result in exception - known as Underflow.\n",

    "* **IS EMPTY** : used to check whether the queue has any element or not, so as to avoid Underflow exception while performing dequeue operation.\n",
