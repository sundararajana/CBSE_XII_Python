    "## Python File Handling - Text Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Many computer programs work with files. Files help in stroing information permanently. But disk file reading/writing is slower compared to memory. Disk data is read/write in big buffers by the Operating system and when file is closed those temporary buffers are \"flushed\" into the disk. That's why it is important to \"close\" files opened for reading and/or writing. When you open a file, you get a \"file handle\" - this does setting up of buffers etc. File read/write happens via the handle. When file is closed, data is flushed from buffer to actual disk storage. File handle is \"disconnected\" from the file at that point."
