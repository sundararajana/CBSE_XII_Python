    "## Python File Handling - Text Files\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Many computer programs work with files. Files help in stroing information permanently. But disk file reading/writing is slower compared to memory. Disk data is read/write in big buffers by the Operating system and when file is closed those temporary buffers are \"flushed\" into the disk. That's why it is important to \"close\" files opened for reading and/or writing. When you open a file, you get a \"file handle\" - this does setting up of buffers etc. File read/write happens via the handle. When file is closed, data is flushed from buffer to actual disk storage. File handle is \"disconnected\" from the file at that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text Files\n",
    "\n",
    "A text file can be understood as a sequence of characters\n",
    "consisting of alphabets, numbers and other special\n",
    "symbols. Files with extensions like .txt, .py, .csv, etc.\n",
    "are some examples of text files. When we open a text file\n",
    "using a text editor (e.g., Notepad), we see several lines\n",
    "of text. However, the file contents are not stored in such\n",
    "a way internally. Rather, they are stored in sequence\n",
    "of bytes consisting of 0s and 1s. In ASCII, UNICODE or\n",
    "any other encoding scheme, the value of each character\n",
    "of the text file is stored as bytes. So, while opening a\n",
    "text file, the text editor translates each ASCII value\n",
    "and shows us the equivalent character that is readable\n",
    "by the human being. For example, the ASCII value 65 will be displayed by a text\n",
    "editor as the letter ‘A’ since the number 65 in ASCII character set represents ‘A’.\n",
    "Each line of a text file is terminated by a special character, called the End of Line (EOL).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary files are also stored in terms of bytes (0s and 1s),\n",
    "but unlike text files, these bytes do not represent the\n",
    "ASCII values of characters. Rather, they represent the\n",
    "actual content such as image, audio, video, compressed\n",
    "versions of other files, executable files, etc. These files\n",
    "are not human readable. Thus, trying to open a binary\n",
    "file using a text editor will show some garbage values.\n",
    "We need specific software to read or write the contents\n",
    "of a binary file."
